    i. Leaving early is defined as when a member leaves before the meeting has adjourned without returning before adjournment.

    ii. Members who leave a meeting for more than 20 minutes in aggregate shall be considered to have left early, even if they return before adjournment.

    iii. Members who leave and return when a meeting is in recess shall not be considered as leaving early.

  c. Members who are unable, in the judgment of the UA Executive Board, to do their shifts may be excused, with such conditions as the UA Executive Board may impose.

  d. Each missed shift will account for half a Committee absence (0.5 absences) for the semester.

  b. The member will be removed from the UA for all purposes at the next UA General Body meeting occurring no sooner than one week after notification.

  d. In case of systemic religious or medical absences, a member may request a variable length exemption from the attendance policy for no longer than one semester. The Executive Board may approve or deny such requests.

  e. Any time the Executive Board approve such a request, it is required to notify the UA General Body immediately. In the cases of medical absences, the Executive Board will not be required to divulge specific conditions affecting the member receiving the exemption. The General Body shall have the option to veto this approval with a simple majority vote at the next General Body meeting. If no vote is called for by any member of the General Body, the approval is automatically upheld.

6. Procedure for Contesting Removal

  a. A member wishing to contest their removal must submit a letter to the UA Secretary explaining the situation before the General Body meeting at which removal will be contested.

  b. A member who does not contest their removal will be automatically and permanently removed from the UA.

  c. If the removal is contested, a hearing will be held at the General Body meeting immediately after the letter has been received, and the member’s letter will be read aloud, followed by a question and answer period.  

  d. The member in dispute shall then leave the room, and the body will debate whether to provide the minimum forgiven absences needed to maintain membership on the UA.

7. Voting Procedure

  a. Removals shall be immediately repealed by a vote of 2/3 of those members present at the hearing. The removal vote must be taken at the meeting of the hearing.

### Conduct of Appointed Representatives

52. The undergraduate liaisons to the Trustee Standing Committees are ex-officio members of the Undergraduate Assembly, non-voting unless they are also elected representatives.  They are responsible for submitting reports of their committee’s deliberations to the UA Executive Board on a regular basis.  They are also responsible for submitting the position of the UA as that of the student government.

53. The NEC shall establish and enforce an attendance policy for all representatives, with appropriate sanctions for non-attendance.

54. The UA Executive Board shall have the right to remove representatives appointed by the Executive Board if the representative fails to attend what the Executive Board deems a sufficient number of meetings

SECTION VI: Conflicts of Interest and Commercial Endorsement
------------------------------------------------------------

### Definitions


55. A “not-for-profit corporation” is any incorporated entity recognized by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) tax-deductible charity.
All Penn student groups recognized by the Office of Student Affairs are “Penn-affiliated organizations” and do not possess a corporate identity separate from the University, which is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation. For-profit entities that fall under the University or are subcontracted thereby, for example the Penn Bookstore and Penn Dining, are Penn affiliates and are not considered for-profit entities for the purposes of this policy.


56. All other corporations and non-incorporated entities are considered “for-profit entities.” A for-profit concern that offers a product to the University or its students free of charge is still here defined as a for-profit concern.


57. All for-profit companies or concerns, including but not limited to for-profit companies or concerns exclusively operated by faculty, staff, undergraduates, graduates and professional students, or alumni of the University, are here not considered affiliated with the University.


58. The “Penn administration” is all Trustees, officers, and employees of the University of Pennsylvania, broadly defined. This definition is exclusive of full-time undergraduate students.


59. A “financial or governance interest” is a held by a person who has, directly or indirectly, through business, investment, or family a potential or real ownership or investment interest in that entity, or a compensation arrangement with that entity.


60. A “promotion” is defined as the use of UA channels of communication to support a product, service or entity. An "endorsement" is an affirmative statement of support for a product, service or entity. The UA’s internal usage of a service or product does not constitute “endorsement” or “promotion.”


61. In this section, a “UA Member” is inclusive of the UA President and Vice-President, as well as all elected Members and any undergraduate student acting on behalf of the Undergraduate Assembly.

### Responsibilities of UA Members

62. No UA member may propose or vote on a UA resolution or a procedural motion to the advantage or disadvantage of a for-profit entity in which he or she has a financial or governance interest.

63. No UA member may, while intentionally acting in the official capacity as a UA member, lobby the Penn Administration to the advantage or disadvantage of a for-profit entity in which he or she has a financial or governance interest.

64. Members are obliged to disclose their interests in for-profit entities to the UA Executive Board as those interests arise. It shall be the duty of the UA in the final case to determine whether a member must abstain from a vote on a UA resolution, or from lobbying the Penn Administration, owing to a financial or governance interest in a for-profit entity.

65. Nothing in this policy shall be so construed as to prevent members from acting, outside of their official capacity as UA members, to promote and support any kind of corporation as they see fit.

### Responsibilities of the UA

66. Neither the UA nor members of the UA, while intentionally acting in their official capacity, shall promote nor endorse any for-profit entity without a resolution approved by the UA.

67. The UA may establish services for the student body in partnership with external entities as it thinks fit, provided:

  a. Code that is “open source” may be used in UA services, and if necessary shared with others under the terms of that code’s open source license,

  b. The UA shall retain exclusive ownership over the service provided, such that the service can be withdrawn on the sole initiative of the UA.

  c. It complies with all relevant policies of the University of Pennsylvania.

  d. It is approved by the UA through a resolution.

### Student Privacy

68. The UA will not endorse any non-Penn-affiliated entity that collects marketable student identification (including, but not exclusive to student e-mail addresses, PennID numbers, or telephone numbers.)


SECTION VII: Intergovernmental Relations
----------------------------------------

### Membership in the Council of Philadelphia Student Governments

69. The Undergraduate Assembly is a member of the Council of Philadelphia Student Governments (CPSG) and has ratified the Charter of the Council insofar as it does not conflict with these Bylaws, the Constitution of the Assembly, or relevant University regulations.

70. The UA President is the “student body president” of the UA for the purposes of the Charter. The Undergraduate Assembly Governing Body is the “legislative council” of the UA for the purposes of the Charter.

71. The UA Body shall elect one of its members to be the CPSG Representative under internal election procedures. If the CPSG Representative shall step down, they shall be replaced by election at the next Body meeting.

72. If the UA President shall hold the Chair of the Council, the UA Vice-President shall hold the UA President’s representative seat.

73. It shall be the responsibility of the CPSG Representative to represent the views of the UA Governing Body and to keep the Body informed as to the actions of CPSG, and CPSG informed as to the actions of the UA.

SECTION VIII: Finance
---------------------

74. The Budget and Finance Committee shall consist of the Treasurer and two UA members elected at the first or second UA meeting immediately following the Transition Meeting.

75. No UA monies shall be spent, save by appropriations made by the UA in accordance with these Bylaws.

76. There are two kinds of financial business transacted by the UA: contingency requests and the Annual Budget.

  a. The UA shall have a Contingency Fund, to which each year shall be added a minimum of .5% of the total amount allocated to the UA in that year.

  b. The Contingency Fund will retain all unspent funds from year to year, except when the UA votes otherwise.

77. The Speaker shall preside over all contingency requests and the Annual Budget meeting.

78. The procedure for determining Contingency Requests is as follows:

  a. Any Penn-affiliated organization, including the UA, may request funding from this Contingency Fund during the academic year.

  b. The Contingency Fund is a fund of last resort; no request shall be granted which does not convincingly demonstrate that all practical funding alternatives have been exhausted. SAC-recognized groups in particular must approach SAC for funds before submitting a Contingency Request.

  c. All requests shall be submitted on behalf of that organization to the UA Budget Committee, following whatever guidelines the Budget Committee establishes for the form and detail of the request.

  d. The Budget Committee shall review the request in a timely fashion and report their recommendation as a resolution to the UA General Body at their next meeting, unless in the Committee’s judgment the request is an emergency, in which case they shall present it to the UA Executive Board for immediate approval or disapproval.

  e. All contingency requests regarding funds that will be spent on internal operations of the Undergraduate Assembly shall be made by the Speaker Pro Tempore and submitted, in completion, to the Budget Committee in a timely fashion of no less than 48 hours prior to the next UA General Body Meeting, where it will be considered. Should this standard not be met, the Contingency Request must be considered at the next regularly scheduled UA General Body Meeting. No internal contingency request may be considered an emergency request during the contingency process

  f. The General Body shall consider the Budget Committee’s recommendation as if it were an ordinary resolution, save that amendments require the vote of 60% of the members present to be approved.

  g. Approval of the request automatically and irrevocably transfers the specified funds to the Penn account of the organization in question.

  h. The UA will be considered a “co-sponsor” of any event for which it provides contingency funds, and accordingly the UA’s name and logo shall appear on all publicity materials.  

79. The procedure for determining the Annual Budget is as follows:

  a. The Budget Committee shall meet with each branch of student government in Spring Semester and review their finances and activities prior to producing a recommended budget for the UA General Body. For the purposes of the Annual Budget, Budget Committee shall consider the Speaker and Speaker Pro Tempore the representatives of the UA.

  b. The Executive shall set a particular meeting as the Budget Meeting, which shall ordinarily be the UA meeting held immediately before Spring Break. The Budget Committee shall complete their recommended budget no later than two weeks before that date.

  c. The UA may consider the budget only after a meeting during which the Budget Committee and the chief financial officer of each branch (or designate) present the Budget to the full UA in detail, with unrestricted time for questions. The Budget presented at this meeting shall be in all regards identical to the budget considered by the UA at the Budget Meeting.

  d. The Budget Meeting proper shall be run according to the Standing Orders, below.

80. Retroactive amendments to the Annual Budget shall only be made to monies specifically allocated to the UA.

81. The UA will automatically “roll over” all money earned as profit (ie. from the UA shuttle services) in one year to the next year’s operations budget (accounted for as profit). However, if Exec deems it appropriate and necessary to reallocate the funds, then that will be under their purview to do so.

82. The UA will automatically “roll over” all money it does not spend from one year’s Contingency Fund to the next year’s Contingency Fund with the following restriction:

  a. If the Contingency Fund exceeds $50,000, it will be the responsibility of the Budget Committee to meet and discuss the merits of transferring a percentage of the Fund to SAC. If the Budget Committee agrees that moneys exceeding $50,000 should be transferred to SAC, the Committee will make a presentation to the UA general body. The general body will vote to retain the funds as they stand in the Contingency Fund or uphold the Budget Committee’s recommendation of transferring a certain percentage to SAC. A majority of 60% (sixty percent) would be needed to vote in favor of transferring the funds in order for this vote to pass.

SECTION IX: Standing Orders
---------------------------

### Authority

83. No part of this Bylaw shall be so construed as to extend to anything outside of a general meeting. A motion to suspend the rules may suspend any or all of the contents of this Bylaw.

84. Robert’s Rules of Order shall be the parliamentary authority for all matters not specifically addressed in the Constitution or the Bylaws.

85. The Speaker or Speaker Pro Tempore shall interpret all parts of this Bylaw, but any ruling made by the Speaker or Speaker Pro Tempore may be overturned by a simple majority of the UA.

86. The use of the word “members” in these Orders is refers to duly elected Members of the UA. The words “persons” are inclusive of all members of the Penn Community. The word “Speaker” shall encompass the Speaker and the Speaker Pro Tempore when they exercise the position of Speaker.

  c. By a suspension of the rules.

90. The Motion to Consider a Document is a special main motion that must be made at the end of New Business in the following manner:

  a. Before the close of New Business, the Speaker must inquire as to whether there are “any Motions to Consider a Document.”

  b. This motion is made by any member, must be seconded, and is debatable like any main motion. Debate on this motion shall be limited to whether or not the document should be entertained, and not on the merits of the document itself.

  c. The motion cannot be amended.

  d. The motion must be accompanied by a presentation of the document proper for inspection by the UA.

  e. The motion passes with a simple majority of members present in favor. Should the motion pass, that document will be considered at the next meeting held at least six days later in exactly the form it was presented in the Motion to Consider.


### The Orders of the Day

91. All regularly stated meetings of the UA shall include an Open Forum, Old Business and New Business. All meetings shall commence with a Roll Call.

    ii. Before recognizing UA members, the Speaker will ask non-UA members for any additional comments.

    iii. After the Speaker begins recognizing UA members, any non-UA member will be given priority if he/she has an additional comment or topic for discussion.

    i. UA members can add topics to be discussed during the open forum session by submitting the request directly to the Speaker.

    ii. The Speaker will recognize each topic to be discussed in order of their submission. After an initial comment, the chair will recognize any follow-up comments directly concerning the issue before moving on to the next topic.

94. All motions on the table shall be taken from the table and placed before the UA during Old Business.

95. At the close of the UA meeting there shall be Communications from each person in turn, without time limits.

### Consideration of a Document

97. The UA considers each document in the following way:

  a. Three (3) minutes for the proposer(s) to present the document (in the case of budget requests, five (5) minutes for the proposer(s) to present the budget request, and five (5) minutes for the budget committee to present its rationale),

  b. Five (5) minutes for question and answer,

  c. Debate, with speakers alternating pro and con.

    i. Questions may also be asked during this time, and do not contribute to the total time for debate.

    iii. No speech shall exceed three (3) minutes in length, save by a motion to extend time or the discretion of the Speaker.

    iv. If there are no speakers for any one side of the debate, the debate shall become general discussion, with the order of speakers at the discretion of the Speaker.

    v. Debate ends only upon the expiry of time under a Motion to Limit Debate, the passage of the motion to previous question (or other motions which cut off debate), or the exhaustion of debate.

  d. Voting procedure.

98. Two-thirds of the UA may set a maximum time for each speaker (shorter than 3 minutes), a maximum time for debate, the total number of speakers, or any combination thereof, by approving Motion to Limit Debate.

99. A simple majority may, with the passage of a incidental Motion to Extend Debate, overturn the three (3) minute time limit, either in an individual case or generally, and/or any limitation established by a Motion to Limit Debate.

100. The Speaker shall assign the floor to persons in debate, alternating between pro and con as much as practicable. All persons shall have an equal right to speak, save that the President and Vice-President shall be granted preference (in that order) all other things being equal, and, despite the remainder of this clause, the Speaker shall give preference to those persons who have not spoken at all on the motion.

101. Persons ask questions (no distinction is made between Points of Information and Parliamentary Inquiry, and both are handled in this Order), both in debate and in the question and answer session, by raising their Inquiry Placard. All questions are fielded before the next person speaks on the motion. Questions should always phrased through the Speaker , are short and to the point, and must be on a point of fact.

102. Anyone, immediately upon being assigned the floor, may yield the floor and their remaining time to anyone else. All yielding takes place at the absolute discretion of the persons in question.

103. Amendments to a document moved during its discussion are submitted in writing to the Secretary at any time during its consideration. All amendments must include the text that would be changed by the amendment, and the text their amendment consists of. The Speaker shall entertain the amendments so submitted in the order of most destructive to least destructive, the order in which they have been received, or such order as they deem appropriate. Immediately prior to entertaining any motion to previous question on the document, the Speaker shall read out all pending amendments in full.

104. When the Speaker entertains an amendment, it shall be read in its entirety. Following this, the proposer of the document shall be asked if the amendment is friendly or not.

105. If the proposer indicates that the amendment is friendly, it is adopted unless two members of the UA object.

106. If only one member objects, they may at the discretion of the Speaker speak for a brief period outlining his objection. If following this speech there is no second objection, the amendment shall be adopted as above.

107. If the proposer indicates that the amendment is unfriendly, or two or more members of the UA object to the friendly amendment, then the proposer may withdraw their amendment unilaterally. If the proposer chooses not to (i.e. they “make the amendment unfriendly”), the amendment shall be considered normally.

108. Debate on amendments shall proceed in the same way as debate on the main motion, modified as follows:

  a. 2 minutes for the proposer to present their amendment,

  b. 3 minutes for question and answer,

  c. Debate, as for a document.

109. Prior to moving to voting procedure on any amendment, the Speaker shall read the amendment, and the relevant part of the document as it would read amended and unamended.

110. Amendments may not be tabled after previous question is called on the document that is sought to be amended. Should there be amendments on the table when the previous question is moved, the amendments will lapse. All motions to amend a motion previously passed are original main motions and must be moved in a document.

111. All incidental, subsidiary or privileged motions are made by raising placards, or orally as appropriate. If two or more members raise their Previous Question placard, the motion to move to previous question will be considered at the termination of the current speech.

112. No motion for previous question may be entertained before at least one pro and one con speech (or two speeches if either the pro or con side has no speakers).

113. Votes on all main motions and all amendments shall be done by roll call. Votes on all procedural matters shall be done a show of hands or, on objection by at least one member, by roll call.

114. In all cases under Robert’s Rules where a “majority of the entire membership” voting in favor is required for a motion to pass, the votes of two thirds of the entire membership in favor shall be required for passage instead.

115. The results of any vote shall be determined by a comparison of the number of pro votes against the number of con votes. Members have the right to abstain on any vote.

116. If the votes pro or con on the question constitute a majority of the members voting and an absolute majority of quorum, the question shall be resolved in the usual fashion. In all other circumstances when the combined number of pro and con votes is fewer than quorum, the question will be laid on the table.

### The Budget Meeting

117. No other business shall be considered at the meeting at which the Annual Budget shall be considered, and this meeting shall be henceforth referred to as the “Budget Meeting.”

118. The UA will discuss one student government budget at a time, in the following order:

  a. SCUE

  b. NEC

  c. SPEC

  d. UA (including Pre-Orientation Programs and expenses not otherwise accounted for)

  e. Class Boards

119. Before discussion of the first budget, SAC will present its opinion of the overall budget for 2 minutes and have 5 minutes of Q/A (questions and answers each capped at 30 seconds).  

120. At the beginning of discussion for each branch, the UA Treasurer will be given 2 minutes to present the budget committee’s rationale for that branch’s budget.  The Chief Executive Officer (or designate) of the branch will then be given two minutes to present their opinion.

  a. The Speaker Pro Tempore shall, on behalf of the Speakership, be considered the “Chief Executive Officer” for the UA’s internal budget, and shall, for the purposes of the Annual Budget, present and advocate as such

121. Debate then commences on the branch’s budget, with all speeches limited to 1 minute. At this time, members may offer amendments to particular line items.

122. A budget amendment must:

  a. Direct its main force or effect at the budget under discussion; amendments which ultimately affect another budget more than the one being discussed shall be deferred until that budget is discussed, or to General Discussion if that budget’s debate has been closed. At a minimum, at least one line-item in the budget under discussion must be amended.

  b. Specify, in specific dollar amounts, where the money will go and where it will come from. The budget is a set sum; changes to one part of the budget necessitate changes elsewhere.

  c. Be co-sponsored by at least one UA member in addition to the proposer.

  d, Obey all the usual rules of amendments.

123. Line item amendment discussions will be handled as follows:

  a. The Speaker shall arrange amendments in order from most to least destructive, and may arrange for multiple amendments affecting one line item to be debated and voted on at once if doing so will facilitate debate.

  b. The proposer(s) of the amendment will be given 1 minute to explain the amendment, followed by 3 minutes of Q&A (questions and answers capped at 30 seconds each).

  c. The Budget Committee will then be permitted a 1 minute response.

  d. The UA will then begin debate on the amendment, speech times capped to 1 minute. There is no such thing as a “friendly amendment” to the Budget.

  e. After debate is closed (in the usual way), the amendment(s) will be voted on as follows:

    i. If there is only one amendment to be voted on, it shall require the affirmative votes of 60% of members present to be approved.

    ii. If there are multiple amendments being voted on, the Body will vote on each amendment in order of most destructive to least destructive; the first amendment to obtain a 60% majority will be approved and all others discarded. Should no amendment attain a 60% majority, all amendments in the sequence will be discarded.

124. The UA will progress to the next budget when debate has been exhausted on the current budget, or when a motion to close debate has been approved by two-thirds of the UA members present.

125. At the end of discussion of all branches, SAC will be given 2 minutes (with 3 minutes of Q&A) to make a statement on the revised budget.

126. Following SAC’s statement, the UA will enter into a discussion of the budget as a whole (“General Discussion”). At this time, any amendment to any part of the budget may be entertained.

127. Motions to reconsider a specific amendment may be entertained only during General Discussion.

128. During General Discussion, the Previous Question may be called on the whole budget. A majority of the total membership of the UA must vote in favor of the Budget for it to be approved.

129. During the budget meeting, and only during the budget meeting, non-members must be yielded time to speak by a UA member in order to participate in debate. The clock will continue to run during that time as though the UA member had continued to speak. This rule shall not apply to the Chief Executive Officers (or a single designate) of the branch whose budget is under discussion (General Discussion shall not be considered a discussion of any single branch’s budget). The SAC Chairperson (or designate) shall also be afforded the speaking rights of members.

### The Transition Meeting

130. The session of the Undergraduate Assembly shall expire upon the convention of the Transition meeting, and the session of the next UA shall then begin.

131. The agenda of the Transition Meeting shall be as follows:

134. Prior to nominations, all members of the incumbent Executive shall have four minutes explain to the duties of their position to the newly elected UA body, followed by a ten minute question and answer period.

135. Prior to the election of each position, the floor will be open to nominations. Nominations must be accepted by the nominee, and no seconder to a nomination is required.  Self-nominations are acceptable.

136. Following nominations, each candidate shall give a speech in the order of their nomination and answer questions from the UA and the general public within the following time limits:

  a. Speaker: 5 minute speeches, 20 minutes of Question and Answer from UA, 20 minutes of Q&A from general public, answer time for each question is 1 min per candidate.

  b. Treasurer and Secretary: 4 min speeches, 20 Q&A from UA, 20 Q&A from general public, answer time is 1 min.

137. Questions shall be answered by each candidate in turn. The Chair of the Transition meeting shall alternate the order in which the candidates field questions. The first candidate fielding any given question shall be given 30 seconds for a response after the last candidate has fielded the question.

138. A simple majority of the UA may extend the general public question and answer time.

139. Following the conclusion of the question and answer time, the Chair may entertain a motion to Descend into Executive Session. Should the motion be approved by a majority, the UA shall enter an executive session for deliberations.

140. The deliberations shall be conducted according to procedures established within the session, but the Chair of the NEC may moderate discussion and shall supply documentation on past deliberation session practices for UA’s reference. No motions may be considered in executive session save a Motion to Ascend from Deliberations, which must be approved by a two-thirds majority of those UA members present.

141. Following the conclusion of deliberations, or of question and answer (whichever happens last), the UA shall vote by secret ballot to elect one of the candidates. If only one candidate is running for the position, any member may move to elect the candidate by acclamation.

142. The candidate elected shall be the candidate with the votes of an absolute majority of UA members in office. Should no candidate receive the requisite number of votes and there shall be more than two candidates, the candidate with the lowest vote total shall be discarded and the UA shall reballot, continuing in such a fashion until a candidate is elected. But the UA may, if there are two candidates who do not receive an absolute majority of votes, return to deliberations.

### Other internal elections

143. Such other positions as the UA shall deem appropriate to be elected from its membership shall be filled during a quorate meeting according to the procedure in this Article.

144. All elections shall be announced at a meeting at least six days prior to the meeting at which the election shall be held. This announcement shall include a description of the position under election, the criteria for holding the position, and at least five minutes for questions to previous holders of the position, if any.

145. No officer of the UA shall be elected to a secondary internal office.

146. At the meeting at which the election shall be held, the election shall be considered an item of new business.

147. Prior to the election of each position, the floor will be open to nominations. Nominations must be accepted by the nominee, and no seconder to a nomination is required.  Self-nominations are acceptable.

In the ordering of questions, members of the UA shall be given priority.

149. A simple majority of the UA may extend the question and answer time.

150. Following the conclusion of question and answer, the UA shall vote by secret ballot to elect one or more of the candidates as appropriate, each member casting one vote per position. If there are an equal number of candidates to positions (or fewer candidates than there are position), any member may move to elect the candidate(s) by acclamation.

151. The candidate(s) elected shall be the candidate(s) with a plurality of votes cast; save that if there are more than three candidates for a given position the votes shall be cast by the optional preferential method, where each voter numbers the candidates in order of preference. Then, all the first preference votes are counted, and the candidate with the least number of first preference votes is discarded. The second preferences indicated on the ballots of that candidate are then considered as first preferences and redistributed accordingly, continuing in this fashion until a candidate has a majority of votes.

152. If quorum is not present, or the combined total of votes for candidates is less than a majority of members present, then the position shall be declared vacant and elected at a future meeting according to the procedure in Article VI. An abstention is not a vote for a candidate.

### Impeachments

153. Any UA member, including the President, Vice-President, or any Executive officer, may be impeached for misconduct or incompetence, by written charges preferred by at least one-third of the total number of UA members or five percent of the undergraduate population.

154. This indictment shall be presented to the NEC, who shall determine the petition’s legitimacy in accordance with such procedures as the NEC shall establish. The petition shall clearly state, if it impeaches an officer, whether it requests the removal of the person from office or from the UA entirely. A President or Vice-President who is removed from their position automatically forfeits their seat on the UA.

155. Upon impeachment of a member or officer, a trial to determine guilt shall be held not less than one, or more than three weeks subsequent to the impeachment. The date of the trial shall be fixed by the NEC.

156. If the impeached member is an Executive Officer they shall be suspended from their office. Interim replacements are determined as follows:

  a. In the case of impeachment of the President, the Vice-President shall serve as Interim President.

  b. In the case of the simultaneous impeachment of President and Vice-President, the Speaker shall serve as Interim President.

  c. If the President, Vice-President, and Speaker shall be simultaneously impeached, the NEC shall convene an emergency meeting of the UA to elect by the procedure established for the election of non-Executive Officers an undergraduate to serve as interim President.

  d. In the case of the impeachment of any other officer, the President or Interim President shall with the advice and consent of those unimpeached members of the Executive Board appoint an Interim replacement.

157. The signatories of the petition of impeachment, or such persons as the petition shall nominate, shall appoint a prosecutor, who shall be a currently enrolled undergraduate. The accused shall be allowed to choose a defense counsel as he or she may think proper, provided that the defense counsel be a currently enrolled undergraduate. The prosecutor and defense counsel may have advisors present at the trial, but only the prosecutor and defense counsel may make arguments and cross-examine the witnesses.

158. No trial shall be held without at least one week’s public notice. It shall be treated as an emergency UA Meeting for the purpose of the UA attendance policy. The Chair of the trial shall be the NEC Chairperson or designate. This person, hereafter referred to as “the Chair”, shall have final discretion over the interpretation of all the rules pertaining to the trial subject to the review of a majority of the UA.

159. The form of the trial shall be as follows:

  a. The charge or charges shall first be read by the Chair.

  b. After the charges are read, the prosecutor and defense counsel may present opening and closing remarks, and also call and cross-examine witnesses in accordance with the customs of the courts of justice. The impeached member shall be considered innocent of each charge until proven guilty by a preponderance of the evidence.

  c. The UA shall, following this presentation’s conclusion (by an expiry of time or a vote to close the presentation approved by two-thirds) descend into a private deliberations session at which only unimpeached UA members and the Chair may be present. It may ascend from this session only by a two-thirds vote.

  d. Following the conclusion of deliberations, the UA shall vote on each charge by a recorded vote.

160. Should two-thirds of the UA vote in favor of sustaining the charge made by the impeachment, the result specified in the petition of impeachment (whether removal from office or from the UA) shall take place immediately. There is no appeal. Vacancies generated by the sustainment of the charge shall be filled in accordance with the Constitution and Bylaws.
