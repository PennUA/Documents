----------------------

1. All full-time undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania shall be eligible for membership in all organs of the Undergraduate Assembly (UA).

Article II - The Undergraduate Assembly
---------------------------------------

2. The Undergraduate Assembly shall speak as the one representative voice of all undergraduates on affairs of their concern, and shall express its views on any matter, which its members deem of general University interest, passing resolutions and making recommendations thereto. It shall have power, under the Statutes of the Trustees, to make recommendations directly to the President, Provost, and the Trustees, and to request reports from the university administration.

3. The UA shall be an elective body consisting of the UA President, the UA Vice-President, and members elected from five (5) mutually exclusive constituencies: the new students (inclusive of the freshmen class and the transfer student population admitted that year), the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Nursing Science, the Wharton School, and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

4. The number of representatives from each constituency shall be divided proportionally by the Nominations and Elections Committee (NEC) on the basis of enrollments at the commencement of the academic year using the following procedure:  

  a. The total number of seats on the UA shall be calculated by dividing thec total number of undergraduate students enrolled in the current academic year by 300, and rounding up to the nearest odd number.

  b. Each constituency shall be guaranteed at least one seat.

  c. The remaining seats shall be allocated by the equal proportions method, resulting in a listing of the constituencies according to a priority value, calculated by dividing the population of each constituency eligible to vote by the geometric mean of its current and next seats that assigns the remaining seats.

5. UA members shall be elected as follows:

  a. The members from the new student constituency shall be elected no later than six weeks after the commencement of Fall semester (this election to be hereafter referred to as “the New Student election”), and shall hold office until the beginning of next Transition Meeting.

  b. Members from all other constituencies shall be elected no later than two weeks prior to the commencement of Reading Days in the Spring Semester (this election to be hereafter referred to as “the General Election”), and shall hold office from their election until the beginning of the next Transition Meeting.

  c. The NEC, by and with the advice of the UA, shall establish all other regulations pertaining to UA and Class Board elections, including but not limited to their timing, qualifications for candidacy, qualifications of voters, conduct of elections, and penalties for non-compliance.

  e. Conducted in accordance with such procedures as the Bylaws shall provide,

8. The UA may impeach and remove any UA member for misconduct or incompetence
upon presentment of a petition of impeachment signed by any one-third of UA members or 5% of the whole undergraduate population.
